# Median housing value prediction
The housing data can be downloaded from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ageron/handson-ml/master/. The script has codes to download the data. We have modelled the median house value on given housing data.

## The following techniques have been used:

* Linear regression
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
## Steps performed
We prepare and clean the data. We check and impute for missing values.
Features are generated and the variables are checked for correlation.
Multiple sampling techinuqies are evaluated. The data set is split into train and test.
All the above said modelling techniques are tried and evaluated. The final metric used to evaluate is mean squared error.
### To excute the script
python < scriptname.py >

### packages need to be install before run the code
1. numpy
2. pandas
3. matplotlib
4. sklearn
